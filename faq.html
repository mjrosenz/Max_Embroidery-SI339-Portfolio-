            <h4>how can i start embroidering?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>Just like a friend of mine told me, all you need is your dear friend YouTube and some motivation. Originally, I sought out people I knew who embroidered already, but they all told me the same thing. It is truly one of those hands-on hobbies that require practice to learn.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>how long does it take?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>For an average design, it takes anywhere from three to five hours. I like to spread out my time when I make my designs. I’ll try to do a little more each day.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>what supplies do you need to embroider?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>You need a needle, needle threader (One of the most underrated, essential tools,) embroidery floss, embroidery hoop, scissors, pencil, and embroidery fabric. Sometimes, I like to use a seam ripper when I make big mistakes.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>what's your favorite part of embroidery?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>My favorite part has to the feeling of accomplishment when I finish a portion of a design. Seeing how each little thread comes together on the fabric can be so euphoric.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>where do you get your supplies?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>I got a starter kit from Amazon that was about $12. I wouldn’t spend more than $20 on your first set of supplies. Then, once I knew I wanted to keep embroidering, I visited my local Joann Fabrics and got a nicer hoop, some transfer paper for designs, and extra embroidery floss.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>what size embroidery hoop do you use?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>Currently, I have been using a 6-inch hoop. I think that anything smaller than that is going to be a waste of time.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>can anyone embroider?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>Honestly, no. It requires a lot, a lot of patience as well as a steady hand. Oftentimes, I get frustrated, but that just makes the successes mean so much more.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>what medium can i embroider on?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>I embroider on white cotton squares, but I would recommend something more durable such as toweling. Sometimes, cotton will start to shed and tear, but toweling is strong and can bring some style to your piece.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>how thick should my embroidery floss be?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>To begin, I recommend using three out of six strands of your embroidery floss. Once you get more skilled at embroidering, you may move onto smaller sets of strands. I like using two strands for a satin stitch and three for a backstitch.</p></div>          </div>
          <div class="question_box">
            <h4>can you teach me?</h4>
            <div class="drop_menu"><p>Maybe. I can give you some guidance on what stitches to do for your design and how to plan your piece out. Yet, if you’re looking for a tutorial or lesson, refer to question one.</p></div>          </div>
